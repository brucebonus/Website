## 1.1.1 Background
I have been tasked to create a responsive website or web application that attempts to elevate, and, in part, solve a world problem.
The idea I have come up with is creating a vegan clothing website which promotes different vegan clothing brands. I have chose this problem because I feel like people forget
what materials are used in their clothes. I want to promote that we can wear the same look without the use of animals.

## 1.1.2 Wire Frames
I have used a website called moqups.com to create my wire frames for this project. I will try and stick to these designs for the final outcome of my website. ![wireframe1](/wireframe1.png) ![wireframe2](/wireframe2.png)

## 1.1.3 Colour Choices
The text colour scheme I have chosen to use throughout my website is black and white. I have chosen these two colours for text mainly because it allows me to deepen 
or lighten any colour. It is also very easy to read because they are totally opposite colours. The aesthetic look I was trying to go for is 
kind of a eutopian, nostalgic and dreamy look so I used analog photography images. These images I have used, mostly all have a grainy look which all fits the theme of
my website.

## 1.1.4 Accessibility
I have implemented a form of accessibility within my website by adding alternative tags within the images I have used in my website. I have used this because if the image
or video does not load on the browser, it will show the description text(alternative tag) within the space where the image is. This is useful because a person viewing the
website will have an idea what the image is without the image showing. ![alt tag](/alt_tag.png)


## 1.2.5 GDPR
I have stuck to the General Data Protection Regulation by not using or requesting any data from users. I have met the standards as my website does not use anyones data nor
cookies.

## 1.2.6 Distance Selling
My website can be seen as a commerce site however the website I have aimed for is mainly to promote vegan clothing brands and their products. Therefore I have conformed to the online
and distance selling act.

## 1.2.7 Evalaution
The problem I tried to solve is that there is not enough coverage on vegan based clothing. Most people are unaware on how different types of clothing are actually made, mainly leather and other
animal usage.

In summary I have created a home page, an apparels page showing different brands of clothing and a lookbook displaying what the brands look like on models all using html, css and javascript
from scratch. In the 'apparels' page I have created images and descriptions of a product on what they are made of and the cost of them. I have also made it so when you click
on them, it will send you to the brands website. 

The website is predominantly desktop resposive ![desktop](/responsive_desktop.png). For mobile devices, the homepage and the apparel page are clearly responsive as when I open up the chrome developer tools by pressing 'f12' on my keyboard, I can change different
responsive devices. In this case I used 'iPhone X' to show what the website would look like on a mobile device ![iphone X](/responsive_iphonex.png). However in some parts of the website, the pages arent very resposive as they overlap each
other and it looks like a mess. I tried to fix this by creating a javascript function that allows users to click on an image and it would display a lightbox for them to scroll through images without it being scrambled about on the page.

Fundamentally my aim was to display and promote different vegan based brands in the most simplest way. I wanted to make it so users know what elements can be clicked on. I did this by creating shadows on boxes when the cursor hovers over it. 
I also wanted it to be mostly focused on getting the user to the original brand's website so they can browse through their products.
